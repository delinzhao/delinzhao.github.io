* Hello, Iâ€™m Zhao Delin!
<br>
*  I am pursuing a Master of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (On-board Charger and Wireless Power Transfer) degree at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/)(XJTU), Xi'an. Currently, I am doing research about the on-board charger applied to electrical vehicles and supervised by [Prof. Yue Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37281447000) in the [SKLEI Lab](http://sklei.xjtu.edu.cn). In order to hone my research skills and integrate the learned knowledge into practice, I have been participating in the university-industry collaboration project "**Development of 22kW 800V Bidirectional On-board Charger**" since November, 2021. This project is collaborated with [United Automotive Electronic Systems](https://www.bosch.com.cn/en/our-company/bosch-in-china/united-automotive-electronic-systems/) Co., Ltd. (UAES, Shanghai). 
<br>
* In my first year of graduate school, I did some research in Wireless Power Transfer, including modeling and stability analysis of SS and LCC-S topologies. Additionally, a novel control method called "Periodic Energy Control" was proposed, which has the advantages of fast dynamic response and suppression of system overshoot. The detailed work can be found in the "[Periodic Energy Control for Wireless Power Transfer System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9623422)".
<br>
* Before that, I was an undergraduate of [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/) (JLU). I have been awarded the degree of *B.E. of Electrical Engineering and its Automation* with First Class Honours from JLU and the second degree of *B.A. of English Literature* from JLU in June 2020. Specifically, my undergraduate GPA is 3.58 out of 4 **(89.07/100, ranking: 4/101)**, my graduate GPA is 3.69 **(90.75/100, ranking: 2/42)**, and I rank second in my major, which reflects my learning ability and research foundation.
<br>
* I became interested in electronics when I was a junior middle school student. I enjoy contriving new ideas and accomplish them by experiments! I am proficient in Matlab, Altium Designer, Code Composer Studio (CCS), Quartus II, Keil and other science softwares. As for my English, I had the IELTS test (**Overall:6.5** R:7.0 L:6.5 S:5.5 W:6.0) and GRE test (**Overall:322** V:152 Q:170 AW:3.0).
<br>
* My research interest is in the modeling and control of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and On-board Charger (OBC). 
<br>
