* Before that, I was an undergraduate of [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/) (JLU). I have been awarded the degree of *B.E. of Electrical Engineering and its Automation* with First Class Honours from JLU and the second degree of *B.A. of English Literature* from JLU in June 2020. 
<br>
* I became interested in electronics when I was a junior middle school student. I like contriving new ideas and accomplish them! I am proficient in Matlab, Altium Designer, Code Composer Studio (CCS), Quartus II, Keil and other science softwares.
<br>
* My research interest is in the modeling and control of Wireless Power Transfer(WPT) and On-board Charger(OBC).
